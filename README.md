# mos2-plasmon
Goal of this project is to develop an algorithm to characterize plasmon enhanced MoS2 based phototransistors. 

The plasmonic model on top of monolayer is going to be implemented using open source FDTD solver "Meep". We are going to use the Pyhton interface for this purpose. The transport characteristics of the device will be evaluated using an in-house-built Matlab solver.
